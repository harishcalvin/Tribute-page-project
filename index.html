                <h3>Tom and Jerry is an American animated series of short films created in 1940 by William Hanna and
                    Joseph Barbera.</h3>
                <h3>It centers on a rivalry between its two title characters, Tom, a cat, and Jerry, a mouse, and many
                    recurring characters, based around slapstick comedy.
                </h3>

            <p> The series features comic fights between an iconic set of adversaries, a house cat (Tom) and a mouse
                (Jerry). The plots of each short usually center on Tom's numerous attempts to capture Jerry and the
                mayhem and destruction that follows. Tom rarely succeeds in catching Jerry, mainly because of Jerry's
                cleverness, cunning abilities, and luck. However, there are also several instances within the cartoons
                where they display genuine friendship and concern for each other's well-being. At other times, the pair
                set aside their rivalry in order to pursue a common goal, such as when a baby escaped the watch of a
                negligent babysitter, causing Tom and Jerry to pursue the baby and keep it away from danger.</p>

            <p id="content2">The cartoons are known for some of the most violent cartoon gags ever devised in theatrical
                animat>ion such as Tom using everything from axes, hammers, firearms, firecrackers, explosives, traps
                and poison to kill Jerry. On the other hand, Jerry's methods of retaliation are far more violent due to
                their frequent success, including slicing Tom in half, decapitating him, shutting his head or fingers in
                a window or a door, stuffing Tom's tail in a waffle iron or a mangle, kicking him into a refrigerator,
                getting him electrocuted, pounding him with a mace, club or mallet, letting a tree or electric pole
                drive him into the ground, sticking matches into his feet and lighting them, tying him to a firework and
                setting it off, and so on Because of this, Tom and Jerry has often been criticized as excessively
                violent. Despite the frequent violence, there is no blood or gore in any scene.

                Music plays a very important part in the shorts, emphasizing the action, filling in for traditional
                sound effects, and lending emotion to the scenes. Musical director Scott Bradley created complex scores
                that combined elements of jazz, classical, and pop music; Bradley often reprised contemporary pop songs,
                as well as songs from MGM films, including The Wizard of Oz and Meet Me in St. Louis, which both starred
                Judy Garland in a leading role.</p>

            <p id="content3">Generally, there is little dialogue as Tom and Jerry almost never speak; however, minor
                characters are not similarly limited, and the two lead characters are able to speak English on rare
                occasions and are thus not mute. For example, the character Mammy Two Shoes has lines in nearly every
                cartoon in which she appears. Most of the vocal effects used for Tom and Jerry are their high-pitched
                laughs and gasping screams.
